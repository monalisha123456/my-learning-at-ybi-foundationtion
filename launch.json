Assignment 1: Linear Regression for House Price Prediction

To create a linear regressione model for predicting house prices using the Boston Housing dataset, follow these steps:

1. *Load the Dataset:*
   First, load the dataset from the provided URL:
   python
   import pandas as pd
   url = 'https://github.com/YBIFoundation/Dataset/raw/main/Boston.csv'
   data = pd.read_csv(url)
   

2. *Prepare the Data:*
   Define the target variable y as the MEDV column and the features X as all other columns.
   python
   X = data.drop('MEDV', axis=1)
   y = data['MEDV']
   

3. *Split the Data:*
   Split the data into training and testing sets.
   python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
   

4. *Build and Train the Model:*
   Use the LinearRegression model from scikit-learn to train the model.
   python
   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
   model = LinearRegression()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   

5. *Evaluate the Model:*
   Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).
   python
   from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
   print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
